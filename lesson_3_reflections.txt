When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are sharing with others. Or want others to look at your code/files/work/etc..

Why might you want to always pull changes manually reather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you might modify a file that is not up to date with the remote. Then when you check
	in and  push to the remote you could possible revert someones changes.
