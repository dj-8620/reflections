How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It helped me see the new lines that were introduced so I could quickly search those 
	new lines instead of the entire document

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It can make you more efficient because everytime you introduce a bug you could go 
	back to the previos version of the file, if you could not find the bug.
	You will not have to start from scratch if you break something.
	You could just go back to the last working version 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually chossing when to create a commit, like you
do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	The pros is that you have more control of what to commit and when.
	The cons are that you could forget to commit for a while and end up losing
	some work you did. If something crashed or you created a bug.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Git is made with coding in mind. So it was logical for it to allow saving for multiple files
	in one commit. As most of the time in coding that is the case. 

	While other VCS are made for general purpose. So saving a single file is the 
	best option
