What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a git repository it creates a a hidden meta data
	file called .git. That file stores information/data about each version of the file

	You need to initialize a directory if you want to use git as version
	control for that directory.

How is the staaging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area can be looked at as an intermediate area between the working
	directory and the repository. This is where you add files from the working
	directory to the repository. This gives you more control over what is tracked.
	You can remove files from the staging area before you commit it if you 
	accidently added a file.
